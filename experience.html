    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      I have over ten years of experience supporting children and young people in both
      creative and academic settings. My approach is calm, intuitive, and relationship-based.
      I work with infants, toddlers, children, and teens — helping them feel safe, curious, and
      confident in the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Childcare & Babysitting</h2>
    <p>
      I am experienced with ages <strong>0–14</strong> and especially enjoy supporting families
      during transitions: after school, bedtime, moving between homes, or adjusting to new
      routines. I use a gentle, attentive style and value emotional safety, predictable structure,
      and creativity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Infant care: feeding, diapering, soothing, sleep support</li>
      <li>Creative play: drawing, crafts, reading, nature walks, sensory activities</li>
      <li>After-school support: homework help, calm transitions, snacks, play</li>
      <li>Evenings and bedtime routines</li>
      <li>Meal prep and light household help related to childcare</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creative & Practical Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have a strong background in craft and making — skills that naturally
      translate into engaging, hands-on activities for kids.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drawing, painting, sketchbooks</li>
      <li>Knitting, sewing, bookbinding</li>
      <li>Cooking, sourdough, pickling, and simple recipes for kids</li>
      <li>Nature journaling and observation skills</li>
    </ul>
